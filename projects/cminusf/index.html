<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cminusf</code> is an education-oriented, C-like programming language that the instructor used in course Compilers Principles. It supports most of the syntax in C and a large portion of it is compactible with C or C++.</p>

<p>The project is divided in 5 stages:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Lab1: Lexical analysis(implemented with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lexer</code>) and syntatical analysis(implemented with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bison</code>)</li>
  <li>Lab2: Getting familiar with LLVM IR and how to use IR builder to facilitate the IR generation progress.</li>
  <li>Lab3: Implemented the translation progress, that is, generation of LLVM IR by traversing the AST.</li>
  <li>Lab4: Machine independent optimization. We implemented several optimization passes, including constant propagation, live variable analysis and loop constant hoist.</li>
  <li>Lab5: This phase is optional according to the curriculum syllabus. I decided to extend the language features of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cminusf</code>. 
Within a week, I rendered the compiler to support structures, pointers, arrays, member functions, operator overloading and class templates.</li>
</ol>
